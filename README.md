This project is a High-Frequency Trading (HFT) system implemented in C that integrates with trading APIs to automate trade execution based on data read from an Excel file. The code uses libcurl to handle HTTP requests for executing trades and libxlsxio for reading static trade data, such as stock symbols and available prices, from an Excel file. Users are presented with a list of available stocks from the Excel file and can select a stock, specify the desired quantity, and set a buy price. The project demonstrates how to interact with external APIs for trading, handle Excel file parsing efficiently, and manage user input for dynamic trade execution. This setup is ideal for learning how to build algorithmic trading systems or for experimenting with financial market automation. Note that a real API endpoint and an API key are required for executing trades, and it is crucial to use secure practices for handling sensitive information like API keys.
